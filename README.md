What is differential programming? How is it related to functional programming?<br>
  Differential programming, also known as Dynamic Differential Programming (DDP) is an optimization procedure for path planning used in control theory and robotics:<br>
  DDP is an algorithm that solves locally-optimal trajectories given a cost function over some space. In essence it works by locally-approximating the cost function at each point in the trajectory. It uses this approximation to finds the optimal change to the trajectory (via a set of actions) that minimizes some cost metric (e.g. cumulative cost). In the limit it converges to the optimal trajectory.
